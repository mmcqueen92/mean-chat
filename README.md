~THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS~

This project was made with an AngularJS front-end and an ExpressJS/NodeJS back-end. It uses MongoDB for the database.

The purpose of this project was to further my experience with Angular, Express, MongoDB, and WebSockets. It has been a great learning experience so far and I expect it will continue to be as I put the finishing touches on it and clean up the code.

Here is a screenshot of the main page. More screenshots will be added as I wrap things up.
