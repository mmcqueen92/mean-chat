This project was made with an Angular front-end and an ExpressJS/NodeJS back-end. It uses MongoDB for the database.

The purpose of this project was to further my experience with Angular, Express, MongoDB, and WebSockets. This project familiarized me with Angular and introduced me to WebSockets. 

I'm now much more comfortable with Angular than I was at the start of the project, and I've gotten a general understanding of WebSockets, their purpose, and their implementation.
